For whatever reason, subversion does not do keyword expansion by default. That means that
even if you litter your sources with $Id: $, $Author: $, etc, they will stay as is.
So, even before you begin working with a subversion repository, make the following
changes to your subversion client configuration file:

### Section for configuring miscelleneous Subversion options.
[miscellany]
enable-auto-props = yes

### Section for configuring automatic properties.
[auto-props]
*.cs = svn:keywords=Revision


However, this setting should be done on every developer's workstation (I could not
find a way to enforce it at the repository level, I'd like to be corrected if I'm wrong).

      (above text is from http://www.datafaber.com/blog/comments.jsp?contentId=448)


The setting in the config file is only valid for NEW files, to update existing files use:

d:\cygwin\bin\find . -name *.cs -type f -print0 | xargs -0 svn propset svn:keywords "Revision"
(find is usually windows\system32\find.exe; but we need to use the cygwin version here)

Cygwin\bin\find and xargs are cygwin programs: www.cygwin.com


When changing the keywords available, don't forget to use all file extensions that contain the header.
Currently, these are only *.cs files.
